# Hi, I’m **Animesh Tripathi** 👋

</div>

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Data Scientist** based in **Bengaluru, India**.  I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights and building intelligent systems that make information accessible to everyone.  With a strong foundation in deep learning, natural language processing and large language models (LLMs), I enjoy creating agentic AI assistants and data‑driven solutions for real‑world problems.  I’m currently pursuing my *M.Tech.* in **Computer Science & Engineering (Data Science)** and hold a *B.Tech.* in the same field.  My industry experience (2+ years) spans multimodal retrieval‑augmented generation, SQL agents, and scalable ETL pipelines.

## 🏢 Professional Experience

### Associate Data Scientist @ Philips Innovation Campus (Jun 2023 – Present)

At Philips, I work on multi‑agent AI systems and data engineering projects:

* **Oral Healthcare Chatbot – Multimodal RAG AI:** Developed a LangGraph‑powered, multimodal, multi‑agent system that retrieves insights from oral healthcare project archives across formats such as CSV, Excel, DOCX, PPTX and PDF.
* **TextSense AI – SQL Agent:** Built an agentic assistant that generates and executes SQL queries on Redshift to deliver natural‑language and tabular insights, enabling non‑technical teams to explore data.
* **Patent Document Assistant:** Currently developing an AI assistant that understands and summarizes complex patent documents using NLP techniques.
* **Data Engineering:** Designed and orchestrated robust ETL pipelines with Apache Airflow, implemented GDPR‑compliant data retention pipelines and architected data‑attestation workflows for security risk assessments.

## 🧪 Projects

I love to experiment with new ideas—here are some highlights from my repositories and portfolio:

### Open‑Source Repositories

| Repository | What it’s about | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| **[data_analyst_agent](https://github.com/animesh1012/data_analyst_agent)** | A **Data Analyst Agent** that leverages LangGraph and Streamlit to provide interactive analytical workflows. | Uses LangGraph’s agentic capabilities to query and visualize datasets in a Streamlit interface. |
| **[machineLearning](https://github.com/animesh1012/machineLearning)** | A curated collection of machine learning projects, covering tasks such as income prediction, object detection, sentiment analysis and stock prediction. | Showcases end‑to‑end notebooks and scripts across domains—from income and car price prediction to music genre classification. |
| **[genai_chatbot](https://github.com/animesh1012/genai_chatbot)** | A generative AI chatbot that answers queries about the CCMT counselling process using retrieval‑augmented generation. | Features a LLAMA‑based model with guardrails to reduce hallucinations and optimized inference using VLLM. |
| **[Practice_GenAI](https://github.com/animesh1012/Practice_GenAI)** | A sandbox for exploring generative AI techniques and prompt engineering. | Contains exercises, model implementations and curated resources on GenAI and prompt design. |
| **[Python GUI Projects](https://github.com/animesh1012/pythongui)** | A set of GUI applications built using Tkinter and PyQt5. | Includes a download manager, fantasy cricket game, ticket reservation system, speed tester, tic‑tac‑toe and age calculator. |

### Portfolio Projects

* **Generative AI Counselling Assistant:** Developed a retrieval‑augmented assistant to help students with counselling processes using FAISS for vector search and a guardrail system to mitigate hallucinations.
* **Bird Species Identification:** Designed an audio transformer model that classifies 105 bird species using scraped data from xeno‑canto and achieved 88 % accuracy.
* **River‑Network Extraction:** Built a CNN model to extract river networks from satellite images with data‑augmentation techniques for improved generalization.
